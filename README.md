# EY Open Science Data Challenge

This repository contains the solution built for the level 2 challenge of "EY Open Science Data Challenge" in 2023. With the model presented here, I was able to achieve the 2nd place in Brazil local competition. The challenge's goal was to build a regression model to predict rice production in certain areas of Vietnam.

# Reproduction
